-- 1. Select built-in functions not in common languages
SELECT p.proname, n.nspname 
FROM pg_proc p 
JOIN pg_namespace n ON p.pronamespace = n.oid
WHERE n.nspname = 'pg_catalog' -- Built-in functions are typically in pg_catalog
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM pg_language l 
    WHERE l.lanname IN ('plpgsql', 'sql') 
    AND l.oid = p.prolang
);

-- 2. Use CTE with window function to count functions per namespace
WITH func_counts AS (
    SELECT n.nspname, COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY n.nspname) as total_functions
    FROM pg_proc p 
    JOIN pg_namespace n ON p.pronamespace = n.oid
)
SELECT DISTINCT nspname, total_functions 
FROM func_counts 
WHERE total_functions > 0;

-- 3. DO block to check extension dependencies
DO $$
DECLARE
    ext_oid oid;
BEGIN
    FOR ext_oid IN (SELECT oid FROM pg_extension) LOOP
        IF EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 
            FROM pg_depend 
            WHERE classid = 'pg_extension'::regclass 
            AND objid = ext_oid 
            AND deptype = 'e'
        ) THEN
            -- Log or process extensions with dependencies here if needed
            RAISE NOTICE 'Extension % has dependent objects', (SELECT extname FROM pg_extension WHERE oid = ext_oid);
        END IF;
    END LOOP;
END $$;

-- 4. Complex join to get table attributes and types
SELECT c.relname as table_name, 
       a.attname as column_name,
       t.typname as data_type
FROM pg_class c
JOIN pg_attribute a ON c.oid = a.attrelid
JOIN pg_type t ON a.atttypid = t.oid
WHERE c.relnatts > 10 -- Only tables with more than 10 columns
ORDER BY table_name, column_name;
